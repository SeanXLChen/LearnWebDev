/* The !important declaration in CSS is a way to make a specific style rule take precedence over other potentially conflicting rules.
   However, its use is generally discouraged for several reasons:
   1. It breaks the natural cascade in CSS, making it harder to predict which styles will be applied.
   2. It can make debugging more challenging, as it's not immediately clear why certain styles aren't being applied.
   3. Over-reliance on !important can lead to a maintenance nightmare, especially in larger projects.
   4. It can make the CSS less reusable, as it forces a specific style regardless of the context.
