/* Specificity in CSS determines which styles are applied based on the "weight" or "specificity" of a selector.
   Specificity values are calculated based on the type of selector used.
   Here's a basic breakdown:
   - ID selectors have a specificity value of 100.
   - Class selectors have a specificity value of 10.
   - Element selectors have a specificity value of 1.
   
   When multiple rules target the same element, the one with the highest specificity value will be applied.
*/

/* ID Selector - Specificity value: 100 */
#paragraph-id {
  color: green; /* This rule will be applied since it has the highest specificity */
}

/* Class Selector - Specificity value: 10 */
.class-a {
  color: red; /* This rule will be overridden by the ID selector above */
}

/* Element Selector - Specificity value: 1 */
p {
  color: blue; /* This rule will be overridden by both the class and ID selectors above */
}
